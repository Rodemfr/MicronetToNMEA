All the description below is the result of observations of data traffic transiting between Micronet devices.
The interpretation of this traffic is purely speculative and might be completely erroneous.
The NMEA conversion software seems to work well, so many of these interpretation are probably correct, but a number
of strange behaviors let think that there are also a lot a misinterpretations.

As a consequence, if you want to play with your system and understand it better, you are at the right place. But if
you want to have a robust, reliable, waterproof and extensively tested device, you would better go to your nearest
Raymarine/TackTick reseller.

*** Radio specification ***
***************************

Carrier frequency : 869.780MHz in Europe. Measured on my own TackTick network. I don't know is this frequency might change
                    in some circumstance.
Modulation : 2-FSK
Deviation : +-38kHz
Sync word after preamble : 0x5599
Bit rate : 76800Hz

All data after the sync word is the Micronet message described below.

***************************************
*** Micronet message general format ***
***************************************

When a Micronet device wants to talk to another device, it sends a "Micronet message" on the radio.
A Micronet message is formatted as follows :

|83 03 77 37|02|03 90 87|02|01|07|5A|18 18|xx xx xx xx ...
|    NID    |DT|  DID   |MI|SO|DE|CS| LEN |   
|             MESSAGE HEADER              |    PAYLOAD ...

NID = Network ID, is equal to the Device ID of the network main display. Each device is associated to a unique network
      and will only consider a message if it is addressed to this network.

DT + DID = Device ID (4 bytes) - Unique number identifying the device sending the message. The first byte "DT" defines
           the device type.
     DT - Device Type
          0x01 Hull Transmitter
          0x02 Wind Transducer
          0x03 NMEA Converter
          0x04 Mast Rotation Sensor
          0x05 MOB
          0x06 SDPOD
          0x83 Analog Wind Display
          0x81 Dual Display

MI = Message ID (1 bytes) - Type of the message. Necessary for the receiver to know how to decode payload.
     0x01 Master Request
     0x02 Send Sync Data
     0x06 Set Parameter
     0x07 Acknowledge parameter
     0x0a ?
     0x0b ?

SO = Source - Unclear if this byte really plays a role or not. Interpretation probably wrong.
     0x01 Measurement/non display device
     0x09 Display device

DE = Destination - Unclear if this byte really plays a role or not. Interpretation probably wrong.
     0x00 Broadcast / All devices
     0x09 Display

CS = Check sum of all previous bytes from NID to DE included.

LEN = (Length - 2) of the complete message in bytes, including payload. Value duplicated on two bytes for robustness
      since it is not covered by header checksum.

****************************
*** Network organization ***
****************************

A Micronet network is made of one Master device and several slaves. The master is the device which has been powered
first, so it can be a different device if you have several displays, depending which one you used to start the network.
Only the master device is allowed to initiate RF communication. Master always use message 0x01 (Master request) to
initiate radio communications. Slave devices then answer in a predetermined manner to avoid RF collisions.

"Master request" is sent by master every second and defines precisely when a slave device can talk on the network.
"Master request" gives the list of every device known by the Master and the maximum payload that it can pass in a
message (See detailed description of Master request below).

Each slave device as a "transmission window" made of :
   - a 2000us "guard time" during which nothing should be transmitted. Its role is to separate slaves transmissions
     and to avoid overlap in case of poor timing precision. This practically means that a device must wait 2ms after
     the start of the window before starting RF transmission.
   - Preamble + sync word : 15 bytes set at 0x55 (preamble) followed by 0x5599 (sync word). The total duration of this
     part is 1771us
   - Message data : (14 + PL) bytes of Micornet message data
   - Transmission window is rounded to the upper 244us

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Guard time    | preamble | 0x5599 |   Micronet message  | 244us rounding |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      2000us      |       1771us      |  (14 + PL) * 104us  |    0-244us     |

Slave devices must answer in the same order than defined in "Master request" message. A slave device knows the start
of its transmission window by calculating window sizes of the preceding slave windows. The first window starts just
at the end of "Master request" message.

Theses slave transmission windows are called "synchronous" windows. Their role is to allow a slave device to
periodically send its measured data to the various displays of the network. For example, this is where a wind
transducer will send wind data every second. The sync window is reserved for message 0x02 (Send Sync Data).

There is however another way for a slave device to talk on a network. If a device is not listed in "Master Request"
message or if it needs to send something else than its periodical data, it can use the so called "asynchronous"
window. This transmission window is a special one which is located after the last syncronous window and which can
be used by any device, including master itself.

Typical usages of this window are :
   - For a new device to request an attachement to a network (message 0x03)
   - For an existing slave device to request a window size change (message 0x05)
   - For the Master to verify presence of slave devices in the network (message 0x0a)
   - For a display to transmit a user parameter change to other decives (message 0x06)
   - Etc.
   
The structure of the asynchronous window is the following :

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Guard time    | preamble | 0x5599 |   Micronet message  | 244us rounding |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      2000us      |       1771us      |  (14 + 17) * 104us  |    0-244us     |

Note that an asynchronous commands can not exceed a payload of 18 bytes. Asynchronous window starts 5400us after
the end of the last synchronous window. Since asynchronous commands are subject to collision (any device can
potentially talk in this window), they generally require an acknowledge from the other devices. As an example, a
display device could send a parameter update message (0x06) which requires all other devices to acknowledge it
with message 0x07. In that case others devices will use response windows located after the asynchronous slot.
If other devices do not acknowledge, then it means that a collision likely occured on asynchronous window and
that message must be sent again at a later network cycle.

These response windows have the following structure :

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Guard time    | preamble | 0x5599 |   Micronet message  | 244us rounding |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      2000us      |       1771us      |      14 * 104us     |    0-244us     |

They are located just after each others. And devices will response in reverse order compared to "Master Request"
device list.

Knowing all of this, here is the chronology of a network composed of devices A, B, C, D, E. A being the master.

|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| A : 0x01 (BCDE) | B : 0x02 | C : 0x02 | D : 0x02 |  5400us  | Async window | Ack E | Ack D | Ack C | Ack B | Ack A | 
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|

**************************************
*** Message 0x01 (Master resquest) ***
**************************************

This message is sent by the master device to request slave devices to communicate their measured data.

This message also gives the "PL" value for each device which gives the maximum number of bytes expected in the payload
of the "Send Sync Data" message. Also, if a device has to send several messages, it will be listed twice in the list. This
way, we have a complete temporal map of the data exchange, allowing to know where to transmit our own messages, without
colliding with other devices.

Here is the format (with an example) :

|83 03 77 37|83|03 77 37|01|09|00|72|28 28|83 03 77 37|1C|02 03 90 87|0C|01 0B C0 22|26|81 03 70 82|0E|83 03 77 37|0E|00 00|52|
|    NUID   |DT|  DID   |MI|SO|DE|CS| LEN |    DID1   |PL|    DID2   |PL|    DID3   |PL|    DID4   |PL|    DID5   |PL| ??? |CS|
|             MESSAGE HEADER              |                                 REQUESTED DEVICES                                 |

DIDn - Device we request data from. Note that the sender is giving its own address, letting me think that the message could be
       better interpreted as a way of telling who is part of the network.
       
PL - Maximum payload length of the message expected from the mentioned device. Note that a payload of zero bytes means
     that there is no window at all for this device.

CS - Checksum of the entire payload

*************************************
*** Message 0x02 (Send Sync Data) ***
*************************************

This message is used to send data from one device to dispay(s). It is a response to "Master request" message sent by the main
display to collect data from all sensors. It sends a variable number of fields depending on the Device Type and its available
sensors.
Each field is coded the same way but with variable size and type. The number of fields can be dynamically discovered during
decoding by comparing each field position to the complete message size.

PL Parameter Length ? Seems to be the number of bytes on wich VA is coded.

SQ Sequence number - Incremented by one at each new configuration. Reset to zero at each power-up of the system.
                     Not sure of the usage since I don't see how several configuration messages could possibly have
                     their order changed on the network. Maybe by usage of repeaters?
