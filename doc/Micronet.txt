The following documentation is based on observations of data traffic between Micronet devices.
The interpretation of this traffic is speculative and may contain inaccuracies.
While the corresponding NMEA conversion software appears to function correctly, suggesting that many interpretations are likely accurate,
some observed behaviors indicate potential misinterpretations.

Consequently, this document is intended for those interested in experimenting with and better understanding their system. For a
robust, reliable, waterproof, and extensively tested device, we recommend contacting your nearest Raymarine/TackTick reseller.

*** Micronet message general format ***
***************************************

When a Micronet device needs to communicate with another, it transmits a "Micronet message" over the radio.
A Micronet message consists of a header, which has a consistent structure across all message types, and a payload,
whose content varies depending on the message type.

|             MESSAGE HEADER              |    PAYLOAD     |
|    NID    |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|   
|83 03 77 37|02 03 90 87|02|01|07|5A|18|18|xx xx xx xx ... |

Unless explicitly specified, all values are stored in Big Endian format (MSB first).

NID = Network ID (4 bytes). A unique number identifying the target network for the message. This ID is identical
      to the Device ID of the network's master device. Each device is associated with a single network and will
      only process messages addressed to that network.

DID = Device ID (4 bytes) - A unique number identifying the device sending the message. The MSB of DID (0x02 in the
      above example) describes the device type :
          0x01 Hull Transmitter
          0x02 Wind Transducer
          0x03 NMEA Converter
          0x04 Mast Rotation Sensor
          0x05 MOB
          0x06 SDPOD
          0x83 Analog Wind Display
          0x81 Dual Display
          0x86 Dual Maxi Display 
          0x88 Remote Display 

MI = Message ID (1 byte) - The type of the message. This is necessary for the receiver to decode the payload correctly.
     0x01 Master Request
     0x02 Send Data
     0x06 Send Command
     0x07 Ack Command
     0x0a Ping
     0x0b Ack Ping
     0x0c Enter Remote Mode
     0x0d Exit Remote Mode
     0x14 Send RC Command
     0x18 Initiate Master Change
     0x19 Ack Master Change
     0x1b Ack Remote - Report control capabilities?

DF = Device Flags - It is unclear if this byte has a functional role. It appears to provide information about the
     emitting device's status or properties and is likely a set of bit flags. This interpretation is uncertain.
       0x01 Measurement device
       0x08 Display (or master ?) device
       0x19 Dual Maxi Display?

SS = Signal Strength - An indicator of the signal strength as perceived by the slave device. The value ranges from 0
                       (weakest) to 9 (strongest). It is measured by the slave device upon receiving a 0x01 message from the master.
     0 Weakest signal
     9 Strongest signal

CS = Checksum of all bytes from the previous CS or from the beginning of the message.

LE = (Length - 2) of the complete message in bytes, including the payload. This value is duplicated and has its own
     checksum for robustness.

****************************
*** Network organization ***
****************************

A Micronet network consists of one master device and several slave devices. The master is the first device to be powered on,
so it can be a different device at each power-up if multiple displays are present. Only the master device is permitted to
initiate RF communication. The master always uses message 0x01 (Master Request) to start radio communications. Slave devices
then respond to the "Master Request" message in a predetermined sequence to avoid RF collisions.

"Master Request" is sent by the master every second and precisely defines when each slave device can transmit on the network.
It provides a list of all devices known by the master, along with instructions on how and when they can send their messages
(see the detailed description of Master Request below).

Each slave device has a "transmission window" made of :
   - Preamble + sync word: 16 bytes set to 0x55 (preamble) followed by 0x99 (sync byte). The total duration of this
     part is 1771 µs.
   - Message data : (14 + PL) bytes of message data
   - A 1893 µs "guard time" during which nothing should be transmitted. Its purpose is to allow slave devices time to
     process the message and to provide a buffer for imprecise transmission start times.
   - The transmission window duration is rounded up to the nearest 244 µs.
   
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| preamble | 0x99 |   Micronet message  |    Guard time    | 244us rounding |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      1771us     |  (14 + PL) * 104us  |      1893us      |    0-243us     |

Slave devices must respond in the same order as defined in the "Master Request" message. The PL parameter is also provided
by the Master Request for each slave, allowing for the calculation of each window's duration. A slave device determines the
start of its transmission window by calculating the window sizes of the preceding slave devices. The first window begins
immediately after the "Master Request" message ends. If a device is listed with a payload of zero, it has no transmission
window (i.e., no guard time, preamble, or header).

These slave transmission windows are called "synchronous windows". Their purpose is to allow a slave device to
periodically send its measured data to the various displays of the network. For example, this is where a wind
transducer sends wind data every second. The sync window is typically used for message 0x02 (Send Data).

However, there is another method for a slave device to communicate on the network. If a device is not listed in the "Master
Request" device list, or if it needs to send something other than its periodic data, it can use the "asynchronous window".
This is a special transmission window located after the last synchronous window, which can be used by any device, including
those not yet attached to the network.

Typical usages of this window are :
   - For a new device to request an attachment to a network (message 0x03)
   - For an existing slave device to request a window size change (message 0x05)
   - For the Master to verify presence of slave devices in the network (message 0x0a)
   - For a display to transmit a user parameter change to other devices (message 0x06)
   - Etc.
   
The structure of the asynchronous window is :

|----------------------------------------------------------|
| preamble | 0x99 |   Micronet message  |    Guard time    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
|      1771us     |  (14 + 20) * 104us  |      1893us      |

Note that asynchronous commands cannot have a payload exceeding 20 bytes. The asynchronous window starts 7200 µs after the
end of the last synchronous window. Since asynchronous commands are subject to collisions (as any device can potentially
transmit in this window), they always require an acknowledgment from other devices. For example, a display device might send
a command message (0x06) that requires all other devices to acknowledge it with message 0x07. In this case, other devices
will use subsequent transmission windows, called "Ack windows," located after the asynchronous slot. If devices fail to
acknowledge, a collision on the asynchronous window has likely occurred, and the message must be resent in a later network
cycle. If a device repeatedly fails to acknowledge an asynchronous message, it may be detached from the network by the master.

These Ack windows have the following structure :

|----------------------------------------------------------|
| preamble | 0x99 |   Micronet message  |    Guard time    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
|      1771us     |      16 * 104us     |      1893us      |

They are located just after each others. And devices will response in reverse order compared to "Master Request"
device list.

Knowing all of this, here is an example cycle of a network composed of devices A, B, C, D, E. A being the master.

|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
|   Initial    |            Synchronous            |        |Asynchronous|                Acknowledge                 |

**************************************
*** Message 0x01 (Master Resquest) ***
**************************************
Transmission window : Initial

This message is sent by the master device to initiate a communication cycle on the network. Slave devices use it
to determine how and when they can transmit on the radio.

This message lists all slave devices known by the master and provides the "PL" value for each. PL is the maximum
number of bytes expected in the payload of a "Send Data" message. This creates a complete temporal map of the
data exchange, allowing slaves to know where to transmit their messages, without colliding with other devices.

Here is the format (with an example) :

|             MESSAGE HEADER              |                                 REQUESTED DEVICES                                 |
|    NUID   |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|    DID1   |PL|    DID2   |PL|    DID3   |PL|    DID4   |PL|    DID5   |PL| ??? |CS|

DIDn - Devices IDs of devices attached to the network.
       
PL - Maximum payload length of the message expected from the mentioned device. Note that a payload of zero bytes means
     that there is no transmission window for this device.

CS - Checksum

PL = Parameter Length - Number of bytes on which VA is coded.

VE = Version - Incremented by one for each new value sent to other devices. It resets to zero at each system power-up.
             This number prevents writing the same value to EEPROM multiple times, which can occur if a device is
             unresponsive and the sender repeats the command (up to 5 times). This mechanism extends EEPROM life.

PI Parameter ID - Id of the parameter to be changed in the page

    CO   PI
   0xFF 0x00 Water speed factor
      VA = 8bit unsigned integer. Value is 0x32 + speed correction in % (e.g. 0x30<=>-2%, 0x37<=>+5%)

AL = Alarm ID - ID of the alarm to be acknowledged.

VE = Version - Incremented by one for each new value sent to other devices. It resets to zero at each system power-up.
             This number prevents writing the same value to EEPROM multiple times, which can occur if a device is

AL = Alarm ID - ID of the alarm to be raised.

VE Version - Incremented by one at each new value sent to other devices. Reset to zero at each power-up of the system.
             This number is used to avoid writing several times the same value into EEPROM. This can happen when a
			 device is not responding in which case the sender might repeat the command up to 5 times. This extends
			 EEPROM life time.

**********************************
*** Message 0x07 (Ack Command) ***
**********************************
Transmission window : Acknowledge

This message is sent by a slave device to acknowledge a "Send Command" (0x06) that was transmitted in the asynchronous
window. The master device uses this acknowledgment to detect collisions on the asynchronous window and to determine
if the "Send Command" needs to be resent.

Example :
|83 03 77 37|83 03 77 37|07|09|09|80|13|13|
|    NID    |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|
|             MESSAGE HEADER              |


***************************
*** Message 0x0A (Ping) ***
***************************
Transmission window : Asynchronous

This message is used by the network's master to probe for connected devices. It is also used to remove devices
from the network that have not been detected for several power cycles.

Example :
|             MESSAGE HEADER              |
|    NID    |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|

*******************************
*** Message 0x0B (Ack Ping) ***
*******************************
Transmission window : Acknowledge

This message is sent by slave devices in response to a 0x0A (Ping) message from the master.
The payload's content is unidentified but appears to be status or property flags.

Example :

|             MESSAGE HEADER              |  ?  |
|    NID    |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|??|CS|

******************************************
*** Message 0x0C (Remote Control Start) ***
******************************************
Transmission window : Asynchronous?

This message is broadcast by the remote control device to indicate it is entering remote control mode.
It is followed by a 0x14 "Send RC Command" message to select the active controlled device.

Example :

|             MESSAGE HEADER              |
|    NID    |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|

******************************************
*** Message 0x0D (Remote Control End) ***
******************************************
Transmission window : Asynchronous?

This message is broadcast by the remote control device to indicate it is exiting remote control mode.
It is followed by a 0x06 "Send Command" message, which is then acknowledged (0x07) by the controllable displays (including the remote itself).

Example :

|             MESSAGE HEADER              |
|    NID    |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|

**************************************
*** Message 0x14 (Send RC Command) ***
**************************************
Transmission window : Asynchronous?

This message sends a remote command to a controllable display device.
It contains an RC command and the target device ID.

Message example :

Send "v" button press to display device
|             MESSAGE HEADER              |    RC COMMAND   |
|    NUID   |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|RC|    DID1   |CS|
|88 0B 29 06|88 0B C9 44|14|01|09|80|12|12|05|BD 78 0B 86|CB|

RC = RC Command
     0x05 "v" button press (chapter)
     0x06 long "v" button press (on/off)
     0x09 "o" button press (set)
     0x0a long "o" button press (setup)
	 0x0d "<" button press (page left or adjust value left)
	 0x11 ">" button press (page right or adjust value right)
	 0x12 long ">" button press (backlighting)
	 0x13 long ">" button press (backlighting) -- /!\ both 12 and 13 are sent on a long ">" press
	 0x24 select upper pane on dual displays (only tested on a Maxi display)
	 0x25 select lower pane on dual displays (only tested on a Maxi display)

DID1 = target device

CS = Checksum

Note: It is uncertain if an RC command can be sent directly to a display without a preceding 0x0C command.

********************************************************
*** Message 0x18 (Initiate Master Change) ***
********************************************************
Transmission window : Synchronous?

This message is used to initiate a change of Master device. 
It is sent by the current master to another device it selects (selection criteria are unknown).
A typical case seems to be the Remote Display willing to give up its Master status to another (bigger) Display device.

Message example :

Initiate Master change from the Remote Display to a Dual Maxi Display
|             MESSAGE HEADER              |     FIELD    |
|    NUID   |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|    DID1   |CS|

**********************************************
*** Message 0x19 (Ack Master Change) ***
**********************************************
Transmission window : Acknowledge?

This message is the acknowledgment from the device that received the 0x18 request, confirming it will become the new Master.

Message example :

Maxi Display acknowledging to becoming the new Master
|             MESSAGE HEADER              |
|    NUID   |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|

******************************************************************
*** Message 0x1b (Ack Remote - Report control capabilities ??) ***
******************************************************************
Transmission window : Acknowledge?

This message is sent by the controlled device after it receives its first 0x14 (Send RC Command) message.
For example, on a dual display, it is not sent when selecting the bottom pane or receiving menu navigation commands,
but it will be resent each time the remote control switches back to controlling that device.

Message example :

Acknowledge Remote state
|             MESSAGE HEADER              |FIELD|
|    NUID   |    DID    |MI|DF|SS|CS|LE|CS|VA|CS|
